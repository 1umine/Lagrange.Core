## Known Problem
~~- [ ] Signature Service is currently not established, so the login tend to be failed and return code may be 45, you can establish your own sign service by rewriting the `Signature` static class.~~

Thanks KonataDev/TheSnowfield for Provision of Signature API

- Signature of Windows and macOS is missing, you need to figure out by your self
